This is the ACID GNOME-Shell theme by Padster/theRealPadster. 
Based on the ACID suite (http://sixsixfive.deviantart.com/art/ACID-280889262) by SixSixFive (http://sixsixfive.deviantart.com/)

This theme is for GNOME 3.8.
Python is required for the colour changer.
The theme uses Cantarell as the font, so it is highly recommended that you have it installed. 

Instructions:
First, extract the zip, then copy the theme to ~/.themes
So, copy the "ACID" folder to "/home/username/.themes/ACID"

To use the colour changer, just click on the "ACID Configurator" icon, or run the python file (configurator.py) yourself.
